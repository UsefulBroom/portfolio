    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Daniel Schmelzer, a passionate web developer with a strong focus on creating dynamic, interactive websites using Blazor and Azure. With a background in building robust, scalable applications, I specialize in Blazor-based solutions, leveraging Azure Functions and static websites to create modern and efficient web experiences. My love for clean, minimalistic design is evident in my projects, where I combine functionality with visually appealing aesthetics. When I'm not coding, I’m exploring new technologies, pushing the limits of my creativity, and ensuring my work aligns with the latest industry standards. Whether it’s working on web development projects or developing custom solutions for clients, my goal is always to provide seamless, efficient, and elegant digital experiences.</p>
